Our team worked on the wheels and the motor for the wheels and finished both of the wheels. This includes soldering wires to the motors, attaching the rubber on the wheel and then attaching the wheel to the motor. 

We also performed the appropriate measurements and drilled the holes for the motor base accordingly on the wooden base of the robot.
