Our team worked on the wheels and the motor for the wheels and finished both of the wheels. This includes soldering wires to the motors, attaching the rubber on the wheel and then attaching the wheel to the motor. 

We also performed the appropriate measurements and drilled the holes for the motor base accordingly on the wooden base of the robot.

We finished the base of robot by attaching the motors on both sides and the auxillary wheels on the remaining two sides. For the wheels we had to measure and cut two additional pieces of wood to add height to them for the balance of the base. The wheels were screwed in, while the attachment of motors was done with nuts and bolts.

Questions for the presentations:

#1. The first presentation had an example of a play with a robot. The play was Metamorphosis by Kafka, but I found the symbolism and the idea of a play that includes a robot instead of the cockroach contradictory to the main message of the novel. Robots are designed to be helpful to humans and symbolize efficiency and functionality, whereas the main character becoming a cockroach symbolized him becoming useless and helpless, something people try to get rid of. Hence I had a question of whether there are situations and artworks where a including a robot inherently does not make sense, which seems to be the case for Metamorphosis in my opinion. Of course, the robot could be a cockroach robot instead of a humanoid robot, so the question might only apply to humanoid robots and traditional robots in a sense that they are made to support humans, however I still think a case could made for even a cockroach robot, simply because the idea and symbolism we put into robots.

#2. During the second presentation I had a lot of questions about the design of Telenoid robots. The robots only have a torso, head, mouth, eyes and arms. The arms are unnaturally short and the head lacks details by only having eyes and a mouth. The robot is very minimalistic which I don't think alligns with the goals it is designed to accomplish. It is primarily used to establsh a communication channel for the elderly and provide support by keeping them company, however the almost eerie design looks repulsing and I can hardly imagine it reminding the elderly of their relatives/grandchildren. If the design intends on being cute and friendly, it could have been made to look more cartoonish and toy-like, instead the robot looks like a crossbreed between a human and an eraser.
