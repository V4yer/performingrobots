The plot can be interpreted from the movie The Dark Knight Rises and changed to correspond to the robot-style. The seven characters in the play would be the following.

1.	Batman
2.	Bruce Wayne
3.	Bane
4.	Catwoman
5.	Alfred 
6.	Henchman (for fight scenes)
7.	Commissioner Gordon

One or two of the characters could be swapped to the following.

8.	Talia al Ghul
9.	Lucius Fox
10.	Scarecrow


The play could be a recreation of scenes and addition of our own elements and modifications to them, but the rough timeline would be divided into 5 scenes:
Scenes:

1.	Same as the first scene in the movie, starts with a scene in a plane  with Bane and introduces his motives.
2.	Batman VS Bane. The famous fight between Batman and Bane in the dark with an 
iconic dialogue which can be shaped into a robot context.
3.	The climb from the pit that Bruce Wayne performs. We could implement a robot with an ejection or jumping mechanism to reach the effect.
4.	Scarecrow judging people and the walk on ice/ Catwoman and Batman scene on the roof.
5.	Dumping the atom bomb while sacrificing himself to end the play with, same ending as in the movie. The movie ends with Alfred seeing and silently nodding to Bruce in Florence, while Bruce is sitting in a caf√© with Catwoman.

The play could also be switched to the movie The Dark Knight with the Joker and Harvey Dent as characters.
We could also try to combine the plots of the two movies if there is more stage time.
